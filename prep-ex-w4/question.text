1. What are the collections?
Answer: In MongoDB, the collections related to the food recipes could include:

"ingredient": Stores information about various ingredients.
"recipe": Contains documents with details about different recipes.

2. What information will you embed in a document, and which will you store normalized?
Answer:

Embedded Data: Certain details such as recipe steps, ingredients, and categories might be embedded within a recipe document.
Normalized Data: References to other entities like categories and ingredients would likely be stored in separate collections.

3. Discussion:
Answers and Considerations:

The decision to embed data was primarily based on the need for quick access to essential recipe details without additional database calls.
Assumptions:
Recipes might not have an excessive number of steps or ingredients, making it feasible to embed them.
Limited changes are anticipated in the embedded data, reducing the need for frequent updates.
Queries and Commands: For example, commands to add recipes, ingredients, or categories in MongoDB.

4. Choosing Between MySQL and MongoDB:
Answer: I would choose MongoDB due to its flexible schema and native support for document storage. Reasons include:

Document-based structure aligns well with recipes containing varied details.
Easier scalability and flexibility for unstructured data.
Allows embedding data, which simplifies queries for recipes and related information.
